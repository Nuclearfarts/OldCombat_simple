# OldCombat_simple
Simple LaunchWrapper tweakclass mod to bring back spam clicking.

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
In .minecraft/versions, create a folder called 1.14-oldcombat. Paste 1.14-oldcombat.json into this folder. Open the Minecraft launcher (restart it if it's already running), click "edit profile", and select the version "1.14-oldcombat" from the dropdown. (I use an old launcher because I dislike the new look, so it's probably slightly different on the current version.)
